A64, 32 bits

registers: W(32 bits), X(64 bits), case-sensitive, both is okay but cannot mix them up

immediate does not need to start with `#`

terms: `< >`->user-supplied value; `{ }`->optional items; `[ ]`->alternative characters; `uimmn/simmn`->unsigned/signed `n`-bit immediate;

condition code(0000-1111): each is corresponded to a mnemonic, for example 0110->VS, it has different meanings for integer and floating-point numbers, and it can be expressed as an expression of Z/C/N/V

GP registers: W0-W30/X0-X30, zero: WZR/XZR=W31/X31, stack pointer: WSP/SP
